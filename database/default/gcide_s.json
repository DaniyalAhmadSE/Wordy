"To owe; to be under obligation for",
"To be obliged; must",
"As an auxiliary, shall indicates a duty or necessity whose obligation is derived from the person speaking; as, you shall go; he shall go; that is, I order or promise your going. It thus ordinarily expresses, in the second and third persons, a command, a threat, or a promise. If the auxillary be emphasized, the command is made more imperative, the promise or that more positive and sure. It is also employed in the language of prophecy; as, “the day shall come when . . . , ” since a promise or threat and an authoritative prophecy nearly coincide in significance. In shall with the first person, the necessity of the action is sometimes implied as residing elsewhere than in the speaker; as, I shall suffer; we shall see; and there is always a less distinct and positive assertion of his volition than is indicated by will. “I shall go” implies nearly a simple futurity; more exactly, a foretelling or an expectation of my going, in which, naturally enough, a certain degree of plan or intention may be included; emphasize the shall, and the event is described as certain to occur, and the expression approximates in meaning to our emphatic “I will go.” In a question, the relation of speaker and source of obligation is of course transferred to the person addressed; as, “Shall you go?” (answer, “I shall go”); “Shall he go?” i. e., “Do you require or promise his going?” (answer, “He shall go”.) The same relation is transferred to either second or third person in such phrases as “You say, or think, you shall go;” “He says, or thinks, he shall go.”  After a conditional conjunction (as if, whether) shall is used in all persons to express futurity simply; as, if I, you, or he shall say they are right.  Should is everywhere used in the same connection and the same senses as shall, as its imperfect. It also expresses duty or moral obligation; as, he should do it whether he will or not. In the early English, and hence in our English Bible, shall is the auxiliary mainly used, in all the persons, to express simple futurity. (Cf. Will, v. t.) Shall may be used elliptically; thus, with an adverb or other word expressive of motion go may be omitted"

"sir isaac newton": [
"A famous English mathematician and natural philosopher, born at Woolsthorpe, near Grantham, Lincolnshire, Dec. 25, 1642 (O. S.): died at Kensington, March 20, 1727.  His father, Isaac Newton, was a small freehold farmer.  He matriculated at Cambridge (Trinity College) July 8, 1661; was elected to a scholarship April 28, 1664; and graduated in Jan., 1665.  At the university he was especially attracted by the study of Descartes's geometry.  The method of fluxions is supposed to have first occurred to him in 1665.  He was made a fellow of Trinity in 1667, and Lucasian professor at Cambridge in Oct., 1669.  He became a fellow of the Royal Society in Jan., 1672. Newton's attention was probably drawn to the subject of gravitation as early as 1665.  The story of the fall of the apple was first told by Voltaire, who had it from Mrs. Conduitt, Newton's niece.  Kepler had established the laws of the planetary orbits, and from these laws Newton proved that the attraction of the sun upon the planets varies inversely as the squares of their distances.  Measuring the actual deflection of the moon's orbit from its tangent, he found it to be identical with the deflection which would be created by the attraction of the earth, diminishing in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance.  The hypothesis that the same force acted in each case was thus confirmed. The success of Newton's work really depended on the determination of the length of a degree on the earth's surface by Picard in 1671.  The universal law of gravitation was Completely elaborated by 1685.  The first book of the \"principia\" or \"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\" Was presented to the Royal Society, April 28, 1686, and the entire work was published in 1687.  In 1689 he sat in Parliament for the University of Cambridge, and at this time was associated with John Locke; in 1701 he was reelected.  When his friend Charles Montagu (afterward earl of Halifax) was appointed chancellor of the exchequer, Newton was made warden of the mint, and in 1699 master of the mint.  The reformation of English coinage was largely his work.  The method of fluxions, which he had discovered, was employed in the calculations for the \"Principia,\" but did not appear until 1693, when it was published by Wallis.  It also appeared in 1704 in the first edition of the \"Optics.\"  On Feb. 21, 1699, he was elected foreign associate of the French Academy of Sciences.  In 1703 he was elected president of the Royal Society, and held the office till his death.\n    Newton was buried in Westminster Abbey on 28 March, eight days after his death.  His grave is close to a monument in the Abbey erected in his honor.   The Latin inscription reads: Hic depositum est, quod mortale fuit Isaaci Newtoni.  This may be translated as “Here lies that which was mortal of Isaac Newton”.  Before the funeral his body lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber and his coffin was followed to its grave by most of the Fellows of the Royal Society.  The Lord Chancellor, two dukes and three earls were pall bearers.\n    Newton is most commonly known for his conception of the law of universal gravitation, but his other discoveries and inventions in mathematics (e.g. the binomial theorem, differential and integral calculus), optics, mechanics, and astronomy place him at the very forefront of all scientists.  His study and understanding of light, the invention of the reflecting telescope (1668), and his revelation in his Principia of the mathematical ordering of the universe are all represented on his monument in Westminster Abbey"

It is called also acellular slime mold",
"Any of several remarkable amoebalike organisms of the phylum Acrasiomycota, mostly terrestrial, having a fruiting phase resembling that of the acellular slime molds, but being cellular and nucleate throughout their life cycle; called also cellular slime mold.  The most studied species is Dictyostelium discoideum.  In their feeding phase, they live like amoebae as individual cells, engulfing bacteria as a prime food source.  When the food source diminishes, they begin to aggregate, swarming together to form clumps which may move toward heat and light, so as to reach the surface of the ground; they then differentiate into a form with spores contained within a sporangium resting on a stalk.  When the spores are carried to another location with adequate food supplies, the spores may germinate to resume the life cycle.  The phase of aggregation appears to be initiated by release of cyclic AMP, serving as a signal between the individual cells.  The formation of the fruiting body has some similarities to differentiation in multicellular organisms, but the mechanisms are still under study.  Some biologists object to the classification of Dictyostelium as a slime mold, as it is neither a mold nor slimy"

"string theory": [
"A mathematical theory for describing the properties of fundamental particles, which represents the particles as one-dimensional string-like objects, which exist in the normal four dimensions of space-time plus additional dimensions, the total dimensions being ten, eleven, or twenty-six depending on the version of the theory.  The properties of fundamental particles in string theory and their manner of interaction with each other depend upon the modes of vibration of the strings{17}.  The attractiveness of this theory rests in part on its ability to provide a unified treatment of gravity as well as the three other basic forces of nature, in a manner consistent with quantum mechanics.  The great difficulty of doing the calculations required by the theory, however, has thus far (1999) made it impossible to calculate the observable properties, such as the mass, of known particles, such as the electron, proton, mesons, quarks, and neutron; thus there is as yet no experimental verification for the theory.  The most popular version of the theory depends on a mathematical property called supersymmetry, and the theory derived form this principle is properly called superstring theory, a term which is often used interchangeably with string theory.  See also string{17}"
