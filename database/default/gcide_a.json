"A heavier-than-air flying machine using such a device to provide lift; an airplane.  In a modern aeroplane, the airfoils are called the wings, and most of the lift is derived from these surfaces.  In contrast to helicopters, the wings are fixed to the passenger compartment (airframe) and do not move relative to the frame; thus such a machine is called a fixed-wing aircraft.  These machines are called monoplanes, biplanes, triplanes, or quadruplanes, according to the number of main supporting planes (wings) used in their construction.  After 1940 few planes with more than one airfoil were constructed, and these are used by hobbyists or for special purposes.  Being heavier than air they depend for their levitation on motion imparted by the thrust from either propellers driven by an engine, or, in a jet plane, by the reaction from a high-velocity stream of gases expelled rearward from a jet engine.  They start from the ground by a run on small wheels or runners, and are guided by a steering apparatus consisting of horizontal and vertical movable planes, which usually form part of the wings or tail.  There are many varieties of form and construction, which in some cases are known by the names of their inventors.  In U.S., an aeroplane is usually called an airplane or plane"

His most important services were rendered to pure geometry, but his popular fame rests chiefly on his application of mathematical theory to mechanics.  He invented the water-screw, and discovered the principle of the lever. Concerning the latter the famous saying is attributed to him, \"Give me where I may stand and I will move the world \" (do`s pou^  stw^ kai` to`n ko`smos kinh`sw).  By means of military engines which he invented he postponed the fall of Syracuse when besieged by Marcellus 214-212 b. c., whose fleet he is incorrectly said to have destroyed by mirrors reflecting the sun's rays.  He detected the admixture of silver, and determined the proportions of the two metals, in a crown ordered by Hiero to be made of pure gold.  The method of detecting the alloy, without destroying the crown, occurred to him as he stepped in the bath and observed the overflow caused by the displacement of the water. He ran home through the street naked crying heureka, \"I have found it.\"  He was killed at the capture of Syracuse by Marcellus",
